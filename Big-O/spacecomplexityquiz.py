Space complexity: How much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm (auxiliary space complexity) note: not worried about space taken up by the inputs

1. Which of the following are constant space?
    a. strings
    b. booleans
    c. numbers
    d. undefined
    e. array of 5 elements
    f. empty array

2. What is the space complexity of the following:
    a.  for i in range(n):
            print(i + i)


    b.  new_array = []
        for i in range(n):
            new_array.append(i)


    c.  for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                return i * j
