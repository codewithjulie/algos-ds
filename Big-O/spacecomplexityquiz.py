Space complexity: How much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm (auxiliary space complexity)
not worried about space taken up by the inputs

Which of the following are constant space?
a. strings
b. booleans
c. numbers
d. undefined
e. array of 5 elements

What is the space complexity of the following:
for i in range(n):
    print(i + i)

What is the space complexity of the following:
new_array = []
for i in range(n):
    new_array.append(i)

What is the space complexity of the following:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        return i * j
