How could you simplify the big O expression of each of the following?
1. O(n + 10)
2. O(2n)
3. O(1000n + 500n)
4. O(5n^2 + 100n + 25)
5. O(1000)
6. O(n^2 + n^3)

What is the time complexity of the following:
for i in range(5000):
    print(i + i)

What is the time complexity of the following:
for i in range(n):
    print(i + i)

What is the time complexity of the following:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        return i * j

Place the following big O expressions in order from fast to slow:
* O(log n)
* O(n)
* O(1)
* O(n^2)
